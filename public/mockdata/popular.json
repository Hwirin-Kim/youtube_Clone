Plus anytime that I do find time to play, my sister bugs me to keep the noise down. That's why I decided to build a secret gaming room under my bed in a hidden room so that I can play all the games I want in peace and quiet. So my mom and sister didn’t find out about this project, I sent them to Japan for the week. This was tricky, but we figured it all out and it turned out incredible! I love my new gaming room, but it was insane and super intense to make. Luckily we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next. \n\nIf you’re reading this you’re a real one! \nComment “I want a secret gaming room!\" so I can notice you!\n\nNot I Built a Secret Gaming Room to Hide From My Mom, But I Built a Secret Gaming Room Under My Bed, But I Built a SECRET Gaming Room to Hide From My Friends, But I Built a SECRET Gaming Bunker In My Room *No One Knew*, But I Built a Secret Room to Hide from my Wife, But i built my DREAM Hidden Gaming Room in my Parents House, But I Built a Secret Room to Hide from My Family, But Secret Hidden Gaming Room Inside a Couch, But I Built An EPIC Hidden Gaming Room In My House *PS5*, But I Built a Secret Room in Public, But I Turned an Old Dumpster into an Epic Secret Room, But INCREDIBLY INGENIOUS Hidden Rooms and Secret Furniture , But I Built a Secret Room, But I Built An EPIC Hidden Gaming Room In My New House, But Hidden Entrance INSIDE Stairs To DREAM Gaming Room, But I Found The ULTIMATE HIDDEN GAMING ROOM In My New House or any other video like JStu, FrenchieFries, Brent Rivera, Brianna, Jake Carlini, Ben Azelart, AllWeDoIsFun, Zealous, Tiana Wilson, Dangie Bros, Drew Dirksen, Carter Sharer, MARKO, Interesting & Creative Designs, Chris & Emily, Unspeakable, MrBeast, Faze Rug, or Airrack would make.

          "description": "Check Out Lenovo’s Amazing Gaming Laptops! ➔ https://www.lenovo.com/us/en/legion/legion-intel\nI built a hidden gaming room to hide from my sister!!\nBeem Team Merch! ➔ https://www.beemteam.shop\nSUBSCRIBE for a chance at $1,000! ➔ https://www.youtube.com/c/Mbeem10?sub_confirmation=1\n\nNEW VIDEOS EVERY TUESDAY!\n\n📱 FOLLOW MY SOCIALS 📱\n➽ Instagram - @MatthewBeem\n➽ Twitter - @MatthewBeem\n➽ TikTok - @MatthewBeem\n\nEver since I was a kid I’ve been a gamer, but lately it has been hard to find the time. Plus anytime that I do find time to play, my sister bugs me to keep the noise down. That's why I decided to build a secret gaming room under my bed in a hidden room so that I can play all the games I want in peace and quiet. So my mom and sister didn’t find out about this project, I sent them to Japan for the week. This was tricky, but we figured it all out and it turned out incredible! I love my new gaming room, but it was insane and super intense to make. Luckily we had lots of laughs along the way. I love making these videos and can't wait for you to see what is next. \n\nIf you’re reading this you’re a real one! \nComment “I want a secret gaming room!\" so I can notice you!\n\nNot I Built a Secret Gaming Room to Hide From My Mom, But I Built a Secret Gaming Room Under My Bed, But I Built a SECRET Gaming Room to Hide From My Friends, But I Built a SECRET Gaming Bunker In My Room *No One Knew*, But I Built a Secret Room to Hide from my Wife, But i built my DREAM Hidden Gaming Room in my Parents House, But I Built a Secret Room to Hide from My Family, But Secret Hidden Gaming Room Inside a Couch, But I Built An EPIC Hidden Gaming Room In My House *PS5*, But I Built a Secret Room in Public, But I Turned an Old Dumpster into an Epic Secret Room, But INCREDIBLY INGENIOUS Hidden Rooms and Secret Furniture , But I Built a Secret Room, But I Built An EPIC Hidden Gaming Room In My New House, But Hidden Entrance INSIDE Stairs To DREAM Gaming Room, But I Found The ULTIMATE HIDDEN GAMING ROOM In My New House or any other video like JStu, FrenchieFries, Brent Rivera, Brianna, Jake Carlini, Ben Azelart, AllWeDoIsFun, Zealous, Tiana Wilson, Dangie Bros, Drew Dirksen, Carter Sharer, MARKO, Interesting & Creative Designs, Chris & Emily, Unspeakable, MrBeast, Faze Rug, or Airrack would make. This is a video where Matthew Beem (aka MBeem10) builds a secret hidden gaming room under a bed to hide from his sister!\n\n@lenovolegion  @intel #ad #LenovoLegion"

        "description": "Team USA took on Japan for the 2023 World Baseball Classic Championship. Fireworks started early as Trea Turner hit a solo home run in the second to start the scoring. Munetaka Murakami would answer with a solo home run of his own. Kazuma Okamoto would hit a solo home run of his own in the fourth inning and Japan would take a 3-1 lead. In the 8th inning, Kyle Schwarber gave the USA some hope as he launched a solo home run.
